        <div>
          <p>Any Player can only own a single user account of Epic Eleven. However, in special cases, Epic Eleven allows the creation of a second account. To do this, you must receive written consent of Epic Eleven before opening a second account, so is Epic Eleven’s final decision to let a User possess two user accounts. If this condition is not met, any penalty that Epic Eleven suits fit will be issued at Epic Eleven’s staff discretion and may involve the closure of all involved user accounts and the retention of cash within, if we determine that has been obtained fraudulently.</p>

        <div>
          <p>There are certain behaviors that are detrimental to Epic Eleven and the other players. These behaviors may imply the cancellation of some (or all) of the functions associated with a user account. As a result of the foregoing, users whose accounts have been canceled shall respect the disciplinary measures imposed. All communication pertaining to the restoration of a user account must be made through the email account <a href="mailto:support@epiceleven.com">support@epiceleven.com</a>.</p>

          <p>All open tournaments that take place in Epic Eleven have a certain prize and a number of specific participants. If at the start of the tournament this number of participants is not reached, it may be canceled. For example, a competition "One on One" without 2 competitors and a league of 10 people with only 9 participants can not be held. In every case, is up to Epic Eleven discretion to cancel a contest.</p>

          <p>Users can withdraw its participation in any contest by clicking the "Cancel Entry" button at the bottom left of the section in which you can edit your team. Once the tournament has started, the button "Cancel entry" will disappear from that section. Epic Eleven will not consider requests for cancellation of entries in competitions that are completed during the first 15 minutes of the start of the game. Epic Eleven has no obligation to attend requests for cancellation that are not received or that have been received after the deadlines listed above in this section, due to technical difficulties or other reasons. Also, Epic Eleven will not attend requests to cancel registrations in contests "One versus One".</p>

        <div>
          <p>Any player involved in team transaction processes might affect current contests, may these players being in a team that is no longer his actual team. Our player lists are updated once a day (at 00:00), so keep in mind that contests might have been created several days before the transfer was made, which results in players being available for their old teams, not for their new teams. Also, in some cases, a player might not be available for a contest since he was transferred to a team that does not fit into that very contest, so unless the player selects an alternate player, the transferred player would be credited with zero points.</p>
          <p>When a transaction is under negotiation the player may still appear in the list of player of his former team. If he plays against his former team, he may still be awarded with points, as he plays in the same game, which usually will be included in the same contests. Points may not be accurately awarded, but will be reflected at the end of the game. Is worth noting that the settlement of the contest may be delayed in order to ensure maximum accuracy.</p>
          <p>In very rare cases, a player is transferred early enough in the day to play a game for his new team the same day. If it is transferred from a team that plays a game later in the evening to a team that will play a game earlier, you might be able to select the player for later game, knowing that the transfer was made de facto before the game. If this is the case, the transferred player would be credited with zero points.</p>

          <p>During the game we received the events from our supplier, OPTA. After the game, they provide us with a final document with full match statistics. Once received and confirmed, contests will begin to be settled. However, on rare occasions, our provider might review those documents, which may alter the final box score. If this were to happen, the player's score on Epic Eleven will not be updated. Note that this situation is not the same as a case where a correction must be made after closing due to a problem with the data source or the resolution process.</p>
