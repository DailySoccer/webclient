          <p>The players involved in negotiation processes can affect the development of the tournaments that have already been planned considering these players in their old equipment. The listings players Epic Eleven teams are updated once a day (at night). Keep in mind that the tournaments are created with an advance of 5-6 days before the match, so players who are under negotiation may not be available for tournaments that include a game with his new team, but not with his old team. Also keep in mind that, in some cases, a player who has been selected is no longer available for a tournament that will play his old team and his new team. In this case, the user should select an alternate or be credited with zero points for the player in question.</p>
          <p>Note that, the same day that a player is under negotiation, may still appear in the list of players from his former team. If negotiation is occurring precisely negotiations with the player in the same game the rival team in which you are involved, you'll still receive points for participating in the competition. These points may not accurately reflect during the live score, but will be considered at the time of completion of the game. Also note that settlement may be delayed tournament in order to ensure maximum accuracy.</p>
          <p>In very rare cases, a player is transferred early enough in the day to play a game for his new team the same day. If it is transferred from a computer playing a game late to a team that will play a game early, you can select the player for the game to take place so late knowing that the transfer was made de facto before the game. If this is the case, you will be assigned zero points for their performance.</p>
